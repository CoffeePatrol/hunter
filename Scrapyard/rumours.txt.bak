Each guild hunter can offer the player an assignment from their list of rumours. They will provide the player with an assignment even if the player has already received an assignment from another hunter. Each hunter will remember which rumour they assigned to the player, so receiving an assignment from another hunter will not reset or erase the assignment they provided.

However, only one rumour can be actively pursued at a time. The active rumour will be whichever one was most recently accepted by the player. The player can speak freely to the other guild hunters to switch their active rumour to one offered by them.

For example: The player may get an assignment from Ornus, then immediately turn to Cervus to receive an assignment from her as well. Cervus' assignment will now be the active rumour. However, if the player prefers the assignment that was given by Ornus, they can speak to Ornus again to make his assignment active.

Typically, a hunter will not offer the player a new assignment until the player completes the rumour they already offered. However, there are two options to bypass this: a complete reset and an individual reset.
Complete reset

Should a player find all of the rumours currently assigned to be undesirable, they can speak to Huntmaster Gilman to have all assignments reset. To do this, the player must have an assignment on offer from Gilman that is not currently active. When the player attempts to switch their active rumour to the one offered by Gilman, a prompt will appear asking players whether they wish to do his "old" rumour or a "brand new one". Selecting a "brand new one" will reset all other stored rumours. Players must then complete Gilman's new rumour before being able to receive any new rumours from the other hunters.
Individual reset

Players may also reroll a single rumour assignment without resetting all assignments across the entire guild. For players setting up a block list, please note that the rerolled rumour can not be stored as a "block", so this method has limited usefulness for that purpose.

After receiving the undesirable rumour, players can reroll the assignment by switching their active rumour to another guild hunter, completing that one, then before receiving any new assignments, speaking to the original hunter again. The original hunter will now assign a new rumour. If the player switches their active rumour to another hunter before completing this new rumour, the hunter will revert to offering the original assignment.

For example: A player speaks to Ornus and receives a Pyre Fox rumour. The player then speaks to Cervus, accepts her assignment and completes it. Before receiving another assignment from Cervus, the player speaks to Ornus again. Now, Ornus will offer a new assignment that is not Pyre Foxes. If the player completes this new rumour, Ornus will once again offer a new assignment. However, if the player does not complete it and instead switches their active rumour away from Ornus, Ornus will revert to offering Pyre Foxes. Undoing the new rumour in this way can sometimes be useful; such as, if the previous rumour was better in some way than the new rumour given by the above method, then the player could get the previous assignment back. Beyond that, there is likely limited utility with this specific mechanic.
